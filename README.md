# H2O-Higgs-Boson
H₂O Higgs Boson refers to a machine learning project using H2O.ai's AutoML to classify Higgs Boson signal and background events from particle collision data. This dataset originates from CERN's ATLAS experiment, where the goal is to distinguish between real Higgs Boson events and noise.

Project Overview
This project leverages H2O AutoML, a powerful open-source machine learning platform, to train various models (like Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forests, Deep Learning, and Stacked Ensembles) for achieving high classification accuracy. The aim is to maximize model performance, pushing towards 100% accuracy while preventing overfitting.
